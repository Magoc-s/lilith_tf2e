"""
path_listener.py
(C) Lilith 2023
An adaptation of the functionality that py watchdog promised, but couldn't quite deliver
A threaded (via multiprocessing) watcher that rather than triggering events, just returns data via a queue
The use case for this is when the file you are watching is being changed asynchronously by another process,
and you are looking to grab the appended data as it is appended.

I.e. something like a `console.log` file that grows throughout the process lifetime of an application
